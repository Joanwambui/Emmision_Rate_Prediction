# Emmision_Rate_Prediction

Creating Machine learning models to predict the emission rates of different kinds of vehicles.In this project the following steps were taken in order to come up with the most suitable machine learning model tailored to our needs.

1.)Import libraries 

2.)Load the dataset 

3.)Perform Exploratory Data Analysis-check for null values,datatypes,visualizations 

4.)Encoding for non-numerical data types

5.)Building Models 

6.)Examining the accuracy to determine the best model.
The dataset used for this project is provided.
